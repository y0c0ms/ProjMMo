BATTLE MENU TEMPLATES
====================

This folder is used to store PNG screenshots of the battle menu for accurate encounter detection.

HOW TO USE:
1. Take a screenshot of the battle menu when it appears during an encounter
2. Save it as a PNG file in this folder (any name is fine, like "battle_menu.png")
3. Click "Load Templates" button in the Auto Hunt tab
4. The system will now use template matching instead of unreliable OCR

TIPS:
- Take screenshots of the full battle menu with all 4 buttons visible (FIGHT, BAG, Pokemon, RUN)
- Multiple templates can be used for different battle menu styles
- Templates should be clear and not blurry
- The system will automatically detect any PNG files in this folder

EXAMPLE FILENAMES:
- battle_menu.png
- encounter_dialog.png
- fight_menu.png
- pokemon_battle.png

The template matching system is much more reliable than OCR for detecting battle menus!
